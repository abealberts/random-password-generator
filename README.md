# <Random-Password-Generator>

## Description

This project is a simple password generator that generates random strings of characters based on user selections:

- This project was created to enable users to quickly and easily generate strings of characters that can be used as secure passwords.
- Generated passwords are customizable and take into account the following user selections: password length (between 8-128 char), contains lowercase letters (yes/no), contains caps (yes/no), contains numbers (yes/no), contains special characters (yes/no).
- This web app allows users to up their password security by utilizing custom, random password generation. This makes it harder for malicious parties to guess your password and keeps you safe.
- Throughout this project, I improved my understanding of basic JS concepts through the creation of the random generation code. After wrapping up this project, I feel more confident adding additional features and UI or tackling more advanced projects.
